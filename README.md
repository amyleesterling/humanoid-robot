# Humanoid Robot Program

Status: **V0.1 system specification — concept baseline, not approved for fabrication or procurement**  
Baseline date: 2026-08-05

This repository is the engineering source of truth for a staged **30-inch (762 mm) humanoid-robot program**. The first build is **not a walking humanoid**. It is HR-V0, a bench-mounted, guarded handoff demonstrator with one shoulder axis, one elbow axis, and one parallel gripper. Its validated architecture then becomes HR-30, a child-sized but not child-safe robot.

## Program sequence

1. HR-V0 proves the power, communications, watchdog, emergency-stop, joint-control, thermal, and handoff-test architecture on a bench.
2. HR-30A adds a 13-DOF head, torso, two arms, and two grippers on a bolted child-height pedestal.
3. HR-30B adds the full 30-inch silhouette and supported legs, with fall restraint attached at all times.
4. HR-30C proves powered stance and weight transfer after structural, thermal, fall, and safety gates pass.
5. HR-30D demonstrates dynamic walking under a slack overhead fall-arrest tether.
6. HR-30W is the required end-state: untethered level-floor walking in a controlled test area. Human-facing walking requires a later safety release.

No child may enter the test area during V0. Any later child-adjacent demonstration requires an independent risk assessment, qualified mechanical/electrical review, validated force and stopping limits, and a new released revision.

Run `python tools/check_traceability.py` from this directory to ensure every requirement has at least one verification method and all risk controls reference valid requirements.

## Release rule

Only revisions tagged `BUILD-RELEASE-*` after the review gates in the system specification may be fabricated or energized. Documents labeled concept, draft, or preliminary are planning artifacts, not assembly instructions.
