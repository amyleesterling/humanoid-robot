# HR-30 native body architecture P0.1

**PRELIMINARY - CONFIGURATION AND PACKAGING CAD ONLY - NOT APPROVED FOR PROCUREMENT, FABRICATION, ASSEMBLY, POWERED TESTING, MOTION, OR ENERGIZATION**

This is the first repository-native full-body CAD for Project Button. It freezes the `HR-PROD-030` neutral-pose datums, all 25 candidate axes, the 762 mm overall height, shell envelopes, load-frame envelopes and first component-bay reservations.

It is intentionally an architecture model, not a buildable machine. The STEP contains candidate physical envelopes. The second STEP and GLB add joint-axis and component-reservation references. The package also assigns a provisional actuator/transmission route to every axis and records explicit REUSE / ADAPT / REJECT decisions for the SHA-bound Asimov 1 source rig. Exact joints, materials, wall construction, tolerances, fasteners, harnesses, power hardware, mass properties, collision proof and physical validation remain open.

The straight arm-chain arithmetic is 370 mm reach and 950 mm span: both pass hard limits, but both miss the preferred 360/900 mm targets. This is recorded as an open design correction rather than hidden.
