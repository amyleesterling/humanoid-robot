# Project Button Configuration Management

Package baseline: **HR-30-SYS-R0.2**  
Baseline date: 2026-08-06  
Status: preliminary engineering baseline; not approved for fabrication, procurement, or energization

## Identifier hierarchy

- **HR-30-SYS-R0.2** identifies this integrated systems-specification package.
- Each controlled document retains its own document ID and revision. A document revision is not the package baseline.
- **Project Button Electrical V2.1** identifies the connected KiCad electrical package. Its revision is independent of the systems package.
- **Project Button Electrical V3-P0.1** identifies the historical R16 connected candidate retained in Git history.
- **Project Button Electrical V3-P0.2** identifies the current R17 correction candidate, which moves the watchdog contacts into the two SR1 input returns. `P0.2` remains preliminary: it has not superseded V2.1 and is not a released electrical baseline.
- **HR-V0-FW-P0.1** identifies the preliminary watchdog/supervisor source candidate. It has executable source tests but no released binary or HIL evidence.
- Website releases are identified by their website Git commit and hosted version. A website release is a presentation of controlled artifacts, not an engineering revision.

The label **V2.2** is not a released engineering identifier and must not be used for this package.

## Controlled baseline summary

This baseline contains 62 draft requirements and 40 open risks. HR-V0 and HR-30 release specifications remain unbuilt and unvalidated. Individual files may advance only through a recorded change that updates their revision, linked requirements, evidence, and review disposition as applicable.

## Release rule

Neither a clean ERC result nor a website deployment constitutes design approval. The package remains **PRELIMINARY—NOT APPROVED FOR ENERGIZATION** until the applicable selections, calculations, physical tests, and qualified electrical and functional-safety reviews are complete.
